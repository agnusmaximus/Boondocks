Project Name: Boondock (however, project is in the Linkify directory)

Objectives: To create a cool, simple and fast graphical interface to save links, and organize them
            into bundles.
            
What makes my website interesting is that it uses a clean graphical interface to
store and manage links to other websites. It takes a snapshot of the page that
the link refers to and represents a website through a graphical block. These
blocks can be dragged and dropped into a bundle, which will be stored using
local storage. To visit a link, double click on the block which will create a
new tab to which the user can check out that site. To delete a link, just press
the grey "x" button in the block's bottom right corner. You can also press
delete to delete the link.  This website uses a lot of jquery to create a nice
and simple interface. Be sure to try creating a new bundle on the side bar and
then add a link to the bundle by either selecting the bundle and entering a link
into the input, or by entering a link into the input while no bundle is selected
and then dragging the block that appears into a bundle. You can also delete a
bundle by pressing the delete button while it is selected. To deselect a
selected bundle, just click on the bundle again.
